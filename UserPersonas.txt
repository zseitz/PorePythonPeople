Students:

Larry is a first year undergrad. He just joined the lab. He wants to analyze data that he collected.
Larry needs the tool to be simple, but explain to him how it works. Larry is a beginner undergrad.

Judy is a senior undergrad. She wants to analyze data that she collected. Judy does not need the tool
to be very simple, as she understands how to analyze the data very well, and may need flexibility
in the tool to look at the data in new ways. Judy is a senior undergrad who just completed a class
in the fundamentals of Python and is very technical.

Frank is a second year grad student. He wants to answer new questions about nanopore sequencing that 
have not been asked before. Frank needs the tool to be usable on any enzyme. Frank has taken a little
bit of coding classes, and wants to learn how to make the tool flexible.

Post Doc:

Dave is a post doc. He has a deep understanding of nanopore sequencing. He wants the tool to be advanced
enough to look through many files in detail with relative ease. Dave has completed advanced classes in
programming, and is capable of working and adjusting programs under the hood.

Collaborators:

Grace is a collaborator. She works in a genomics lab, that has never used nanopore sequencing. She was given
tools to run nanopore sequencing, and has data collected, and needs to analyze it. She is very technical,
but has not taken formal coding classes.
