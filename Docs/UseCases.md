component #1: finding data files from database based on metadata (enzyme, buffer, atp conc, etc)
Want to build a gui that takes user input to build subset of database
 * Gui for searching and storing

component #2: event classifier - already exists in matlab pretty well
 * Gui to visualize trace

Component #3: level finder- neural network to automatically identify levels
* Level graph

Use case #1: pulling data by metadata/variable

Use case #2: output sequence read for collaborators and undergrads

Use case #3: comparing across runs by variables (enzyme, buffer, atp conc, etc)
