## Components

# Component #1: Data Navigator
* finds data files from database based on metadata (enzyme, buffer, atp conc, etc)
* gui that takes user input to build subset of database
* allows for general searches for variables/dates/etc as well as manual 

# Component #2: event classifier - already exists in matlab pretty well
 * Gui to visualize trace

# Component #3: level finder- neural network to automatically identify levels
* Level graph

## Use Cases

Use case #1: pulling ranges of data from database by searching or manual selecting of metadata/variables

Use case #2: Sequencing known or unknown DNA/RNA (ID potential tech improvements, or expanded alphabet experiments)

Use case #3: comparing motor enzyme function across variables (buffer, atp conc, pH, temperature, etc)

Use case #4: Non-enzymatic experiments (sensing experiments, bond ruptures, etc)
