## Students:

# Larry is a first year undergrad. He just joined the lab. He wants to analyze data that he collected.Larry needs the tool to be simple, but explain to him how it works. Larry is a beginner undergrad.

# Judy is a senior undergrad. She wants to analyze data that she collected. Judy does not need the tool to be very simple, as she understands how to analyze the data very well, and may need flexibility in the tool to look at the data in new ways. Judy is a senior undergrad who just completed a class in the fundamentals of Python and is very technical.

# Frank is a second year grad student. He wants to answer new questions about nanopore sequencing that have not been asked before. Frank needs the tool to be usable on any enzyme. Frank has taken a little bit of coding classes, and wants to learn how to make the tool flexible.

# Joe is a first year grad student. He wants to adapt the lab's nanopore sequencing to experiment with peptide sequencing. Joe wants to be able to manipulate the code to use with many different enzymes. Joe has some coding experience but needs a relatively straightforward interface to use and edit the tool.  

# Tom is a 1st year grad student. He does not know much about nanopore sequencing, he wants to use the tool to analyze sequencing data he has collected. They would like the tool to be easy to use and easy to learn. He has experience with programming in python.

## Post Doc:

# Dave is a post doc. He has a deep understanding of nanopore sequencing. He wants the tool to be advanced enough to look through many files in detail with relative ease. Dave has completed advanced classes in programming, and is capable of working and adjusting programs under the hood.

## Collaborators:

# Grace is a collaborator. She works in a genomics lab, that has never used nanopore sequencing. She was given tools to run nanopore sequencing, and has data collected, and needs to analyze it. She is very technical, but has not taken formal coding classes.

# Reginald is a collaborator. He does nanopore sequencing in another lab. He works with a different nanopore and wants to analyze his data. He is not very technical, aside from a good understanding of nanopore, and he wants to make sure he can analyze data on his unique pore.
