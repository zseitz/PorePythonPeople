## Students:

* Larry is a first year undergrad. He just joined the lab. He wants to analyze data that he collected.Larry needs the tool to be simple, but explain to him how it works. Larry is a beginner undergrad.

* Judy is a senior undergrad. She wants to analyze data that she collected. Judy does not need the tool to be very simple, as she understands how to analyze the data very well, and may need flexibility in the tool to look at the data in new ways. Judy is a senior undergrad who just completed a class in the fundamentals of Python and is very technical.

* Frank is a second year grad student. He wants to answer new questions about nanopore sequencing that have not been asked before. Frank needs the tool to be usable on any enzyme. Frank has taken a little bit of coding classes, and wants to learn how to make the tool flexible.

* Joe is a first year grad student. He wants to adapt the lab's nanopore sequencing to experiment with peptide sequencing. Joe wants to be able to manipulate the code to use with many different enzymes. Joe has some coding experience but needs a relatively straightforward interface to use and edit the tool.  

* Tom is a 1st year grad student. He does not know much about nanopore sequencing, he wants to use the tool to analyze sequencing data he has collected. They would like the tool to be easy to use and easy to learn. He has experience with programming in python.

* Philantropy is an undergraduate in a biology lab studying fish evolution. Philantropy wants to be able to use the technology to analyze the sequence data of allele variants of minnows collected in the field. Philantropy wants the software to be able to convert nanopore signals to a DNA sequence string. Philantropy is not very familiar with terminal usage, but is comfortable with using computer programs with GUI.

* Seymour Stokes is a rotating PhD student in their first year. For their rotation, Seymour is stoked to see more applications of nanopore technology, and wants to understand if nanopores can efficiently capture and store audio information. Seymour wants to be able to visualize a nanopore sequencer readout and be able to annotate/identify opening and closing events in precise detail. Seymour has some programming experience before but does not have much experience with nanopore technology and would prefer a telegraphed workflow.

* Abhi is an undergraduate student who has been in the lab for a few years. He is interested in streamlining the existing workflow for nanopore sequencing to make it faster and easier to convert traces into DNA sequence reads. He wants to be able to modify the code and introduce new features. He is very experienced with python and has experience in software development. 


## Post Doc:

* Dave is a post doc. He has a deep understanding of nanopore sequencing. He wants the tool to be advanced enough to look through many files in detail with relative ease. Dave has completed advanced classes in programming, and is capable of working and adjusting programs under the hood.


* Angela is a postdoc in their second year. Angela wants to adopt the technology to analyze precise pore opening and closing events for a variety of different experimental conditions to understand the sensitivity of nanopore activity. Angela wants the software to be able to detect these events with precision, or allow for signal visualization. Angela is a highly technical tech wizard, with degrees in biophysics and computer programming.

Maya is a postdoc. She wants to use the program to help facilitate her analysis of long-read DNA to integrate into her current research pipeline. she has previous experience with python coding and understands the basics, but prefers clear documentation and example workflows when using a new program.

Tina is a postdoc in a computational biology lab. She plans to use the tool to generate large amounts of sequencing data quickly, and export the reads to analyze in her own lab's software. She has years of experience with programming in python and feels very comfortable navigating the software for her own needs with or without a GUI. 


## Collaborators:

* Grace is a collaborator. She works in a genomics lab, that has never used nanopore sequencing. She was given tools to run nanopore sequencing, and has data collected, and needs to analyze it. She is very technical, but has not taken formal coding classes.


* Reginald is a collaborator. He does nanopore sequencing in another lab. He works with a different nanopore 
and wants to analyze his data. He is not very technical, aside from a good understanding of nanopore, and he
wants to make sure he can analyze data on his unique pore.

* Jenny is a graduate student collaborator. She works in a protein engineering lab and wants to design enzymes to develop new nanopore sequencing technologies. She wants to test novel enzymes and compare traces from various experiments. She is very experienced with Python and highly technical.


## Other:

* Zara is a consultant at a nanopore sequencing company. Zara wants to understand how available open source software compares to current industry standards in order to understand how to imporve company software and stay ahead of the competition. Zara wants to compare the sequencing results of their company software to the software using internal data files that conform to industry standards. Zara is highly technical, but prefers adherence to typical data input formats for her ease of use.

* Qassandra with a Q is a freelance data analyst with a background in bioinformatics. Qassandra has been hired as a contract research scientist for a prestigious protein design lab that wants Qassandra to analyze the difference in nanopore readouts between different enzyme motors. Qassandra would like to have technology that can be trained on nanopore data and predict whether data has been produced by specific motors to give insights on enzyme performance, which in turn would assist in de novo design of efficient, sensitive nanopore technology. Qassandra is very technical and versed in programming and biophysics, but would prefer to not have to design a machine learning architecture from scratch.  


Rachel is the lab manager. She typically orders enzymes, reagents, and consumables necessary for the sequencing work, and sometimes interacts with the software to do regular data exports. She has limited experience with programming but can easily interact with the software through a GUI for her needs.
